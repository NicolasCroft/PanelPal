    <h1>PanelPal: A Lunar Robot for Cleaning Solar Panels</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to the PanelPal project page! This robot was developed in a high school product engineering class using a PiCrawler kit as the foundation.
      <strong>PanelPal</strong> is designed to crawl across solar panels on the lunar surface and clean them with a custom 3D-printed brush mechanism.
      To adhere to the smooth panel surfaces, it uses gecko-inspired adhesive on its 3D-printed feet.

    <h3>How It Was Built</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Hardware:</strong> PiCrawler kit as a base platform, modified with custom 3D-printed feet
      featuring gecko adhesive for lunar panel traction. A 3D-printed brush assembly is mounted on the robotâ€™s front to remove dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Software:</strong> Python scripts (in the <a href="https://github.com/NicolasCroft/PanelPal/tree/main/code">code folder</a>) control
      the motors and servos that drive the feet and operate the brush mechanism.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>3D Files:</strong> All custom parts (feet, brush attachment) can be found in the
      <a href="https://github.com/NicolasCroft/PanelPal/tree/main/3d models">3D Models folder</a>, ready for printing.
    </p>
