## Background and Motivation
Explain why the project is important for lunar missions,
why solar panels need regular cleaning (dust build-up, etc.),
and how this relates to real-world aerospace challenges.

## Hardware & Electronics
- Base robot: [PiCrawler Robot Kit](link if available)
- Additional components:
  - Raspberry Pi Zero / Pi 4 (whichever you used)
  - 3D-printed brush mechanism
  - Distance sensors, camera module, etc.

## Software
- Python scripts for controlling the motors, reading sensors.
- Sensing & navigation approach:
  - Checking sensor data, controlling servos, etc.
- Link to your [GitHub code folder](./path/to/code) or embed snippets.

## 3D Printed Parts
Images or explanations of the 3D parts you designed.
Embed or link to STL files if you have them in a `3D_m
